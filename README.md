# Take-Home Assignment — The Untested API

A 2-day take-home assignment. You'll read unfamiliar code, write tests, track down bugs, and ship a small feature.

Read **[ASSIGNMENT.md](./ASSIGNMENT.md)** for the full brief before you start.

## A note on AI tools

You're welcome to use AI tools. What we're evaluating is your ability to read and reason about unfamiliar code — so your submission should reflect your own understanding, not just generated output.

Concretely:
- For each bug you report: include where in the code it lives and why it happens
- For the feature you implement: briefly explain the design decisions you made
- If something surprised you or you had to make a tradeoff, say so

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+

```bash
cd task-api
npm install
npm start        # runs on http://localhost:3000
```

**Tests:**

```bash
npm test           # run test suite
npm run coverage   # run with coverage report
```

## Project Structure

```

    app.js                  # Express app setup
    routes/tasks.js         # Route handlers
    services/taskService.js # Business logic + in-memory data store
    utils/validators.js     # Input validation helpers
  tests/                    # Your tests go here

> The data store is in-memory. It resets every time the server restarts.

| Method   | Path                      | Description                              |
|----------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `GET`    | `/tasks`                  | List all tasks. Supports `?status=`, `?page=`, `?limit=` |
| `POST`   | `/tasks`                  | Create a new task                        |
| `PUT`    | `/tasks/:id`              | Full update of a task                    |
| `DELETE` | `/tasks/:id`              | Delete a task (returns 204)              |
| `PATCH`  | `/tasks/:id/complete`     | Mark a task as complete                  |
| `GET`    | `/tasks/stats`            | Counts by status + overdue count         |
| `PATCH`  | `/tasks/:id/assign`       | **Assign a task to a user**              |

### Task shape

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "title": "string",
  "description": "string",
  "status": "pending | in-progress | completed",
  "priority": "low | medium | high",
  "dueDate": "ISO 8601 or null",
  "completedAt": "ISO 8601 or null",
  "createdAt": "ISO 8601"
}
```

### Sample requests

**Create a task**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Write tests", "priority": "high"}'
```

**List tasks with filter**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/tasks?status=pending&page=1&limit=10"
```

**Mark complete**
```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/tasks/<id>/complete
```

## What to Submit

See [ASSIGNMENT.md](./ASSIGNMENT.md) for full submission requirements. At minimum, include:

- **Test files** — covering the endpoints and edge cases you identified
- **Bug report** — what you found, where in the code, and why it's a bug (not just symptoms)
- **At least one fix** — with a note on your approach
- **`PATCH /tasks/:id/assign` implementation** — plus a short explanation of any design decisions (validation, edge cases, etc.)

# Assignment Submission Notes

## Completed Work

- Added unit tests using Jest for the service layer.
- Added integration tests using Supertest for the API endpoints.
- Achieved more than 80% test coverage for statements, lines, and functions.
- Identified multiple bugs and documented them in `BUG_REPORT.md`.
- Fixed the pagination offset bug.
- Implemented `PATCH /tasks/:id/assign`.
- Added validation and tests for the new endpoint.

## Design Decisions

### PATCH /tasks/:id/assign

- Returns **404** if the task does not exist.
- Returns **400** if `assignee` is missing or is an empty string.
- Stores the assignee on the existing task object without modifying other task fields.

## What I'd Test Next

If I had more time, I would add tests for:

- Invalid pagination values.
- Concurrent updates on the same task.
- Multiple assignment scenarios.
- Performance with a large number of tasks.
- Additional edge cases for validation.

## What Surprised Me

The project had no automated tests despite exposing several API endpoints. Writing tests helped identify issues in the existing implementation and increased confidence while adding the new feature.

## Questions Before Shipping to Production

- Should completed tasks be allowed to be reassigned?
- Should invalid pagination values return `400 Bad Request` instead of default values?
- Should deleting a task be permanent or a soft delete?
- Should task updates support optimistic locking to prevent concurrent modification?
